# How to use path variables:
# @app.route('/<int:id>')                                   The variable must be in the path within angle brackets
# def index(id):                                            It must also be passed into the function as an argument/parameter
#     user_info = user.User.get_user_by_id(id)              The it will be able to be used within the function for that route
#     return render_template('index.html', user_info)

# Converter -	Description
# string -	Accepts any text without a slash (the default).
# int -	Accepts integers.
# float -	Like int but for floating point values.
# path 	-Like string but accepts slashes.

# Render template is a function that takes in a template name in the form of a string, then any number of named arguments containing data to pass to that template where it will be integrated via the use of jinja
# Redirect redirects from one route to another, this should always be done following a form submission. Don't render on a form submission.
